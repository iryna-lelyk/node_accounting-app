# Accounting app (Node.js)

An expense tracking app with 2 collections and 5 endpoints for each.
Written on Node.js, Express (using Express Router). Data is saved in files as an array.

Working with endpoints is well-described in the [documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/YURIIHOLIUK_1/Accounting-App/1.0.0)


## How to work
- `npm run dev` - to start server with auto-restart on code change.
- `npm start` - just starts the server.
- `npm run test:watch` - runs tests in watch mode (rerun them automatically on change).
- `npm test` - runs ESLint and tests once.
- `npm run lint` - runs ESLint.
- `npm run lint:fix` - runs ESLint and fix fixable errors.
